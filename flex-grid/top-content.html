        <h2>FlexGrid utility</h2>
        <p>This is not a new Tailwind kind of library, this is at most a tiny bit of something like that. It solves a
            specific problem that occurs in every project more than once. So I get save much of time for less den 3kb
            gzipped and also save you pagespeed because of this tiny size.</p>

                does it do?</h2>
        </div>
        <p>With that little tooling, you only need two classes to create equally sized items grid (multiple rows), where
            the number of columns is based on two settings</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the maximum number of columns and</li>
            <li>the minimum width of an item</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>In (my) real world, that is what you most often need in 90% of websites. You have a Design with 5 boxes in a
            row, so you know you need 5 boxes on desktop but you also need some minimum width to let them look good. Shure
            you can do that all with flexbox an a view mediaqueries to make them 4, 3, 2 or 1 box in a row, depending on
            screensize. But as I wrote before, with my css you only need two classes and not a singel mediaquery!</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><b>To get more specific, it makes the following&nbsp;requirements&nbsp;possible:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Set maximum columns</li>
            <li>Set minimum width of columns</li>
            <li>Align all items centered</li>
            <li>Full rows always uses all the available space of the parent</li>
            <li>All items are always the same width</li>
            <li>This works in every nested context</li>
            <li>The number of columns are automatically set, no mediaqueries for different screensizes needed.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
